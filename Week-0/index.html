        <h2> Hi! Welcome to my IMA Low Res Page </h2>
        <h3> Summer 2022 Show-A-Thing </h3>
        <p> For my Design for Communications class, I wrote a story based on my collge experience 
            and turned it into a short film called RAIN. The setting was my 20th birthday, when I 
            experienced an extreme downfall in my life and almost went depressed. However, the bay 
            area (where I lived) was having much more rain than ever before, unexpectedly. I persoanlly 
            enjoy when it rains, and the later part of the story portrays how the rain inspires me 
            musically through the sound of raindrops and thus creates a unique melody, just for me.
            During the story-making and film-making process, I learned so much about storytelling, 
            the power of film language, and how to convey a story without voice. </p>
